# my_ml_routines
Routines I've written that I typically use for machine learning applications. 

There's a variety of plotting and initial model building. They come in handy when working with pandas dataframes.

They make the initial visualizations/plotting, data cleaning, and modeling quite easy. 

After developing these, I was able to quickly churn out a variety of classification/regression projects.
